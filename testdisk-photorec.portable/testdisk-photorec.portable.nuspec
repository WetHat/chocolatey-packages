    <summary>Data recovery software</summary>
    <description>
    TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table).

    PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.

      PhotoRec &amp; QPhotoRec

      QPhotoRec is a Graphical User Interface (Qt based GUI) version of PhotoRec. More user friendly, it recognizes the same file formats.

      QPhotoRec 7.0-WIP
      PhotoRec remains recommended for advanced users, it can stop a recovery and resume it later, it recovers more fragmented files when brute-force technology is enabled and expert mode is available.

      Improvements
       Reduced false positives for more than 80 file formats.
       .gif: fix filesize detection
       .flv: add Flash filesize detection
       .mpg: detect filesize for MPEG
       .ra: detect filesize for RealAudio3
       Improved algorithm to deal with data fragmentation resulting in a general speed increased
       Speedup brute-force mode. Brute-force mode can recover more fragmented files, but it's still slow and not 100% reliable. You can enable it in PhotoRec Options menu.

      New file formats recovered by PhotoRec:
       .3dm: Rhino / openNURBS
       .ari: ARRI Raw Video
       .camrec: Camtasia Studio
       .dad: Micae DVR
       .dcm: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
       .fp12: File Maker Pro 12
       .kra: Krita
       .mlv: Magic Lantern Video
       .notebook: SMART notebook
       .ora: Mypaint
       .red: RED2 video format
       .rlv: Revelation password
       .vbm: Veeam Backup Metadata
       .woff: Web Open Font Format
