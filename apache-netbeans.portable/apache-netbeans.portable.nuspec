    <description>
      Apache NetBeans is an integrated development environment for Java. NetBeans allows applications
      to be developedfrom a set of software components called modules.
      NetBeans runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris.
      In addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like
      PHP, C, C++, HTML5, and Javascript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE,
      can be extended by third party developers. Apache Netbeans is the successor of Oracle Netbeans whose
      product line ended with version is 8.2. In September 2016, Oracle submitted a proposal to donate
      the NetBeans project to the Apache Software Foundation, stating that it was "opening up the
      NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans constituents a greater voice in the project's
      direction and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond".
      There is no direct upgrade path between Oracle Netbeans and Apache Netbean hence a new
      chocolatey package had to be created.
