    <description>
Apache NetBeans is an integrated development environment for Java. NetBeans allows applications
to be developedfrom a set of software components called modules.
NetBeans runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris.
In addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like
PHP, C, C++, HTML5, and Javascript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE,
can be extended by third party developers. Apache Netbeans is the successor of Oracle Netbeans whose
product line ended with version 8.2. In September 2016, Oracle submitted a proposal to donate
the NetBeans project to the Apache Software Foundation, stating that it was "opening up the
NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans constituents a greater voice in the project's
direction and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond".
There is no direct upgrade path between Oracle Netbeans and Apache Netbean hence a new
chocolatey package had to be created.

**Note**: This package does not depend on a particular jdk since there are so many of them now.
In order to use Apache Netbeans it is required to also have one of the following jdks
(Chocolatey package IDs) installed:

* jdk8, jdk11
* openjdk.portable
* openjdk, openjdk11, openjdk12, openjdk13
* adoptopenjdk, adoptopenjdk8, adoptopenjdk11, adoptopenjdk12, adoptopenjdk13
* zulu, zulu8, zulu9, zulu10, zulu12, zulu13
