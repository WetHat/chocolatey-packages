    <summary>Detailed info about your solid-state disks and harddrives</summary>
    <description>SSD-Z is a lightweight portable program for Windows that reveals a bunch of information about each connected disk device.While the name hints at it being optimized for Solid State Drives in particular, it displays information about platter-based hard drives, removable devices and even optical drives as well.</description>

    <releaseNotes>
    •The keyboard shortcut modifier to change tabs, was changed from Alt to Control. E.g. [Ctrl + 3].
    •Added keyboard shortcuts to resize the window. Using [Alt + 1, 2, 3, 4] will resize the window to 100%, 150%, 250% or 300%. Last two are width only.
    •New Tab: "Config". This tab allows for customization of SSD-Z. The Config tab can be opened by pressing [F2] or from the system menu.
    •Settings are now stored in an INI file, in the same folder as the EXE. What's saved: last active tab, last active device, window position, temperature unit, plus a few other things.
    •The mousewheel can now scroll the visible tabs, if there are too many to fit at once.
    •Partition Tab: The volume list now shows the percentage of free space left.
    •Improved interpretation for certain SMART attributes.
    •Improved several tooltips to be more clear about what the specific field show.
    •Benchmark Tab: Improved the IOPS benchmark by using queue depth.
    •More SSDs have been added to the database.
    •Added support for a few more vendors and their associated logo.
    •Fixed clicking on the temperature field on the device tab to swap unit. This will now property update the displayed temperature, instead of turning into "n/a".
    •Partition Tab: Added a column showing if a partition is aligned on a 4k boundry.
    •DevSlp is now listed in the capabilities, for devices that support it.
    •Removed the "-expand" command line parameter. It has been made useless now that the window size is remembered between sessions.
    •Benchmark Tab: Replaced the specific benchmark selection buttons with a dropdown list.
    •Benchmark Tab: The benchmark data is now remembered, even if another benchmark is activated or another device is selected. Only doing a full refresh, [Ctrl + F5] or bottom left button, will clear benchmark data.
    •Benchmark Tab: Some benchmarks can now be aborted when running. This is just a temporary fix until the benchmarks are properly threaded.
    •Added a keyboard shortcut [F4] to activate the previously selected tab.
    •SMART Tab: The attribute name of the selected item can now be copied to the clipboard using [Ctrl + C] or by double clicking the attribute.
    •Added "system.stay_on_top" option to make SSD-Z stay on top.
    •Identify Tab: Many words now displays a description of what each individual bit means.
    •Added debugging option "system.enum_scsi_debug". When enabled, "\\.\ScsiX:" devices will be enumerated.
    •New Tab: "Submit". Here you can submit your SSD to the TechPowerUp database. Having access to the submitted information of many SSDs will help improve future versions.
    •Increased the default window width, to accommodate the increased number of tabs
