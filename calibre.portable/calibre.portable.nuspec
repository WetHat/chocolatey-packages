    <summary>Calibre is a free and open source e-book library management application.</summary>
    <description>
      Calibre was developed by users of e-books for users of e-books. It saves and manages e-books, supporting a variety of formats. It also supports e-book syncing with a variety of popular e-book readers and will, within DRM restrictions, convert e-books between differing formats. Calibre helps to organize the personal e-book library by allowing the user to sort and group e-books by metadata fields. Metadata can be pulled from many different sources (ISBNdb.com, Google Books, Amazon, LibraryThing). Search for author, title or keyword in the whole library, is possible.

		* Fix language definition on body tag being ignored during conversion
		* Edit book: When importing multiple files into the book, import them in the order sorted by their filenames instead of in random order
		* E-book viewer: Fix print to pdf not working on some windows systems with non-ascii usernames and non-utf-8 system locales. Also make the print to pdf dialog a little easier to use.
		* Edit Book: Fix TOC editor window not remembering its last used size
