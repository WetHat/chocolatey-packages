    <releaseNotes>
      •Eliminated a polling loop which caused reduced battery life on laptops when Atom was open in an idle state.
      •Key binding matches are no longer delayed when longer partially-matching multi-stroke bindings are mapped to  unset! .
      •When multi-keystroke bindings containing printable characters fail to match, those characters are now inserted into the editor. This will enable bindings like  j j  for exiting insert mode to work correctly in the vim-mode package.
